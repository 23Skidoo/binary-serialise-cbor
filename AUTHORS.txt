Some of the core design of this library (particularly the embedding of
builder actions) came from Simon Meier.

People who contributed code, ideas or lively discussion include, in no
particular order:

  Adam Gundry        <adam   [@at] well-typed [.dot] com>
  Austin Seipp       <austin [@at] well-typed [.dot] com>

This package includes code from the 'half' package, particularly the C code
in cbits/half.c. Thanks to Edward Kmett for this.
